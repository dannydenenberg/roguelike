# roguelike
> My attempt at a roguelike game written in Rust. Definitly a work in progress.

## Dependencies
Before installing and running the game, you must install the dependencies for your operating system. The game uses a library called 'tcod': *Rust bindings for libtcod, the C library for making console games.*

1. Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed for your system!
2. Install [tcod](https://github.com/tomassedovic/tcod-rs) for your operating system:
  * [For Mac OS X (my favorite!)](https://github.com/tomassedovic/tcod-rs#building-on-mac-os-x)
    - NOTE: I first had some problems with running on my Mac. [This seemed to fix the issue](https://github.com/tomassedovic/tcod-rs/issues/267#issuecomment-444894130)
  * [For Linux](https://github.com/tomassedovic/tcod-rs#building-on-linux)
  * [For Windows (with MinGW)](https://github.com/tomassedovic/tcod-rs#building-on-windows-with-msvc)
  * [For Windows (with MSVC)](https://github.com/tomassedovic/tcod-rs#building-on-windows-with-msvc)
**NOTE** -> I have not tested this program on windows or linux enviornments. It should work though!

## Installation
Now it's time to actually install the program on your computer.
1. Download or clone the repository: ```$ git clone https://github.com/dannydenenberg/roguelike```

## Running/Usage
1. Go to the project directory: ``` $ cd roguelike```
2. Use cargo (rust's package manager) to compile and run the program: ```$ cargo run```
